## Dockerfiles

This repository was inspired by the blog post [Docker for Pentesters](https://blog.ropnop.com/docker-for-pentesters/)<br>
The goal is to have have a collection of specific purpose containers.

A base Ubuntu Docker instance can quickly be spun up from the command line:
```bash 
docker run -it --rm --entrypoint "/bin/bash" ubuntu:latest
```
